node js  :
single   thread Ssync , Non block  i/O


for each request  is handles by single thread


how a single is handling  alot of request 
event loop 






single thread : all request willl handle one single thread 

each request you do will assign to one event 
and if the request end you will get a response 
and the response is a callback 

async : multiple request are getting proccessed parallely 

non Block :  the request are not blocking each other
